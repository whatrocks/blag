My 3-year-old daughter Tavie and I made a time-travel movie for the inaugural [Belvedere Home-Made Film Festival](https://bhmff.com). Watch the four-minute film here on YouTube:

This project was fun on so many dimensions (get it, time travel). But watching Tavie watch herself on the big screen at the festival was the highlight for me. "Core memory," as they say on Instagram.
