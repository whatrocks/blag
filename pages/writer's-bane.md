That's right, it's a post about writing advice.

Not from me! Goodness, no.

Instead, here's a compendium of books and other odd bits that I've found helpful in my quest. I'll keep this updated when I encounter something new and useful and surprising.

I hope this guide proves useful when you're looking to read about how to write instead of just sitting down and doing the deed.

## Books

- **[Draft No. 4](https://amzn.to/2IWZ1B3) - John McPhee**: The master of creative nonfiction gives you a glimpse behind the curtain, and it's mostly 3x5 note cards and some strange vintage word processing software.

- **[Scriptnotes](https://johnaugust.com/scriptnotes) - John August and Craig Mazin**: "A podcast about screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters." This isn't exactly about writing books, but who cares. It's my favorite weekly podcast about an industry I don't work in. And also, "One Cool Thing."
