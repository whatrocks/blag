We've got a [new blog](https://folio.co/blog) over at [Folio](https://folio.co) and I've used it as an opportunity to write somewhat of a love letter to hypertext and the World Wide Web.

Here's the post - [How Folio connects with suppliers](https://folio.co/blog/how-folio-connects-with-suppliers). After a bit of nostalgia-gazing into the history of the web, the post explains a few different mechanisms for facilitating "procurement" workflows - aka business to business transactions. Also, the post's got all sorts of nice diagrams, courtesy of Folio's co-founder + designer + engineer + musician + all the things [Al Hertz](https://hey.al).

I'm looking forward to sharing more about how Folio makes procurement easy, thanks to the web, on our Folio blog. Building tools for procurement has really given me an even greater appreciation for esoteric document formats and protocols (like [EDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange)). Documents are fun! Everything's a document! It's documents all the way down!
