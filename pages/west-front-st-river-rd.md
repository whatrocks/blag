It's been six years since the [last](/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave) *Hotdog Johnny & the Shady Oaks* show. Well, we're back, and live from the Appalachian Mountain Club in Blairstown, New Jersey with a brand new song: *Ask Me Anything*

As of September 2025, Hotdog Johnny & the Shady Oaks remain:
* Jack Byrnes - Banjo
* Peter Clabby - Electric Guitar, Vocals
* Charlie Harrington - Acoustic Guitar, Vocals

## Solo act

To the continued chagrin of our emcees, I had another song on deck, explicitly not a medley, so as not to violate [Uncle Mike](https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/)'s open mic rules. 

Here's my new song *West Front St. / River Rd.*.

## Weddings with Open Mics

Weddings with Open Mic Nights as the welcome party are the best sort of weddings.

Tess & Michael Forever! Thank you both for an amazing weekend of love and music and frogging and fishing and family! I love you!
