A few weeks ago I participated in this explainer video for the [UCSF Cancer Survivorship program](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/cancer-survivorship-and-wellness-institute) and it's out now:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhqPR-ZWCXc?si=gaqEi_ZR-ZJQI_nE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I think the video does a nice job of explaining the primary mechanism for my ongoing interactions with UCSF over the last few years (I mean, other than the colonosopies). It was also nice to see glimpses of how this program has already helped so many others navigate that post-treatment life re-integration stuff. I'm very lucky to be working with Angela (she's in the video!) on my own post-treatment re-integration *stuff*!

Last related tidbit - if you're into running and in the Bay Area this weekend, the [Run Tiburon 5K / 10K road race](https://www.runtiburon.com/) is this coming Sunday, Sept. 7th (you can still sign up!) and a portion of proceeds go to benefit the UCSF Cancer Survivorship Program. They've even renamed the race "Courage Over Cancer." Somehow I came in 7th place in this race two years ago, which only means one thing - we clearly need more runners to join!
